        in Space Operations through Uncertainty Management and Quantification</h1>
      <p class="projects"><img src="../images/projects/McurieImg.jpeg" class="projects">
        Spacecraft orbiting around small bodies are strongly perturbed by non-Keplerian effects. This may have an unstabilizing
        effect that could lead initially safe orbits to escape or collision trajectories. One major disturbance is the small body 
        inhomogeneous gravity field. Because Earth-based sensors have limited resolution, the gravity has to be sensed while in
        flight. Gravity determination is a key enabler for low altitude mission phases such as descent and landing. Funded by 
        Europe's H2020 program, THOR project aims to develop autonomous GNC capabilities that comprise the determination
        of an accurate gravity field approximation and its use for robust flight operations around small bodies.

      <h1 class="projects">S3TSR Data Analysis - Manoeuvre Detection for Near-Orbiting Objects</h1>
      <p class="projects"><img src="../images/projects/RadarImg.png" class="projects">
        Detecting whether geocentric satellites have maneuvered or not serves to update space awareness
        catalogs. These databases are used to assess conjunctions with other space assets or debris, thus it is vital to keep
        them up to date. We developed maneuver detection algorithms based on Kalman filtering and reachability analysis. These
        are validated by using radar tracklets from the Spanish surveillance network and maneuver data of ESA satellites 
        (e.g. Sentinel). Radar-based systems offer the distinctive ability to track, without interruptions, all the objects 
        passing through its scanning area.

        <img src="../images/projects/PlannacionalImg.png" class="projects">
        Model predictive control denotes an ample set of techniques that use optimization to
        account for system dynamics and constraints. Still, actuator mishaps or poor model knowledge require 
        dedicated solutions. Robust or learning-based MPC forms can intelligently handle system uncertainty. 
        We used a chance-constrained approach to treat thrusters uncertainty in order to ensure safe rendezvous.
        We also studied recursive learning of the gravity model for orbit station-keeping around an asteroid.
        These works were core to my PhD dissertation.
