    <div class="aboutme">
        <p class="normal">Dr. Julio C. Sanchez is an Associate Professor at Universidad de Sevilla. His research focus is advancing autonomous Solar System exploration.
            This broad topic comprises interplanetary trajectory optimization, orbiting in complex environments, deep space navigation, celestial body characterization 
            and pinpoint landing. Traditionally, most of these operations are addressed using lightweight analytic models that capture well first order effects but may 
            fail in detecting complex patterns. Fortunately, current deep learning era has revolutionized numerous domains by providing unprecedented levels of accuracy.
            In that line, Julio's research aims to power analytic techniques by combining them with artificial intelligence approaches. This was the key idea of his former
            H2020 M.Curie fellowship that analyzed the asteroid gravimetry problem. In the past, he has also made contributions in the fields of spacecraft relative motion
            and space surveillance.
